# Can You Bench

Chef follows a progressive bench press routine, starting with a certain weight and increasing the weight by 10 kilograms for each subsequent set. The task is to determine the weight Chef will lift in the 3rd set.

## Problem Description

Chef starts benching with `X` kilograms in the 1st set. In each subsequent set, the weight increases by `10` kilograms. You are required to calculate the weight Chef will lift in the 3rd set.

## Input Format
- A single integer `X`: the weight (in kilograms) Chef benches in the 1st set.  
  (\(1 \leq X \leq 100\))

## Output Format
- A single integer: the weight (in kilograms) Chef will bench in the 3rd set.

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq X \leq 100\)
